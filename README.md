# Using python to work with time series data

The python ecosystem contains different packages that can be used to process time series.

The following list is by no means exhaustive, feel free to submit a pr if you miss something.

# Discussion

We would like to trigger a homogenization of the formats which are used in the python time series community, please see the [concept page](https://github.com/MaxBenChrist/awesome_time_series_in_python/blob/master/standardize_time_series_formats.md)
